## About Hackeed

Besides being a store, Hackeed is an open project — an invitation to hack, share, and play.

We like to put systems to the test, break them apart and put them back together. Always from an ethical perspective… or meta-ethical, depending on who you ask :).

What if ethics itself was just another questionable system?

In the end, it’s about questioning, deconstructing, and building. Never destroying. That’s the spirit!

If you have ideas, questions, projects, or just want to think out loud, get in touch.

Hackeed is exactly that: a living lab where curiosity rules.
