## What is Hackeed?

Besides being a half-invented word, **<a href="https://github.com/damalga/hackeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hackeed</a>** is an online store and an open project. A living lab where curiosity rules, an invitation to hack, share and play.

We like to test systems, take them apart and put them back together. Always from an ethical perspective. Or meta-ethical, depending on who you ask.

What if ethics itself was just another questionable system? In the end, question, deconstruct and build. Never destroy. That’s the spirit!

The frontend is built with **<a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue 3</a>**, deployed through **<a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify</a>**, and the database runs on **<a href="https://neon.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neon PostgreSQL</a>**.

But that’s just one way to do it.  
If you feel like building your own serverless online store, this repository explains how this one is structured so you can use it as a base or do things your own way.

I’ll be glad to help if you need a hand. If you’ve got ideas, doubts, projects or just want to think out loud, reach out. Everything here is open source so you can study it, remix it or launch your own version.

Hackeed runs using **<a href="https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netlify Functions</a>** for backend logic, **Neon <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgreSQL</a>** for product data and **<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>** for checkout. It’s a lightweight **Vue 3 + <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite</a>** app with **<a href="https://pinia.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinia</a>** for state management, **<a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCSS</a>** for styling and a **<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localStorage</a>**-cart that persists even after reloads... I'm sure I'm forgeting many important things, but... This repo isn’t meant to trap you. So **Clone it, learn from it, break it, rebuild it. That’s the point.**
